# About Me 👋🏽

My name is Elias Tavarez. I was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico 🇲🇽, but have spent the majority of my life in the states. 
I am a Data Scientist working for BASF in their Production Artificical Intelligence team located in Freeport, TX. 

I am also currently pursuing my Masters in Information and Data Science (MIDS) from the University of California, Berkeley 🐻.
Prior to my role as a data scientist I was a chemical engineer post-graduation from the University of Michigan (Go 🔵!)

Outside of work, I enjoy:

- ⚽️ Sports | Specially \~futbol~ (I am a big Liverpool fan) but love all sports and doing anything that keeps me moving 🏃🏽‍♂️
- 📚 Reading | Which unfortunately, I don't have as much time as I'd like because of school, but I try to keep up 
- 🎥 Movies | I thoroughly enjoy a good film and specially love watching them with my sister

# Skillset 🪛

Most of the coding I do is in `Python` and all of it's related libraries. However, I have had experience with and can get around with other languages/technologies such as 
`R`, `HTML&CSS`, and `C++` but again, my strength lies with `Python`. As you can imagine by virtue of being a data scientist, I am experienced in:

- Developing and Deploying Machine Learning Models
- Data Wrangling
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Deep Learning (emphasis on Computer Vision)

The goal of my github repo is to demonstrate these skills/technologies I've mentioned and continue to build on them. As I develop new repo's, I'll link them
to the section below to highlight my work :).
